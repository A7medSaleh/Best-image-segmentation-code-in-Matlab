In this code I use K-Means algorithm to do color-based image segmentation. The user set the number of clusters like shown in video and then the image is processed and clustered to the desired number of clusters in a labeled image.

What is nice about this code is that it is fast and it shows the user the color of each cluster so the user can know if he over cluster the image or under cluster it as explained in the video.
Also there is an option to only segment a part of the image inside a bounding box without the need to take this part out but doing this on the original image directly instead.

The code is commented in details at each line to know the idea and algorithm used in it.
